# TODOS

- tiles w/point bonuses
  - dead-ends have thing and a biome
  - if you complete the surrounding biome, an identical dead-end appears on the map
  - and contributing tile owners get an extra point per tile

- idea: largest road network bonus for team (encourages one big network of roads)

- tile artwork layers

- goal: maybe to get team point total to X in Y turns?

- idea: team point thresholds unlock more biomes?
